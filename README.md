## Features

- Monaco Editor for code input
- Real-time transpilation of React JSX
- Dynamic rendering of components
- Error handling and display
- Tailwind CSS support in the output

## How It Works

The application uses Babel to transpile React JSX code into JavaScript, which is then dynamically rendered in a preview pane. It supports Tailwind CSS classes in the rendered output.

## Limitations

- Limited to client-side React components
- Supports a subset of React features
- Isolated preview environment
